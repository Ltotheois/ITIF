This script takes a time signal from a Chirped-Pulse Fourier Transform Spectrometer and transforms it via fast Fourier transform to a frequency spectrum.
The program allows to interactively select the window of the time signal, the window function, and zeropadding. The resulting spectrum is shown and can be saved.
